Game of life implemented in java. Incl. report and some documentation
A pet project of mine, originally for my computer science class.
The project currently supports several things

 - Windowed Fullscreen
 - FPS Limiting
 - Custom Rules
 - Static Brushes
 - Cell erasure
 - Random Fill
 - Frame Stepping
 
Although the new algorithm supports custom algorithms, it is much slower than a static algorithm.<br>
There will be a seperate binary folder for the fast, static game of life version.<br>
Source Code Will not be made available for this older version<br>
Algorithms are in the format<br>
#survive/#birth<br>
where survive is the number of neighbors needed to survive, and birth is the number needed to give life to a dead cell<br>
